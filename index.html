            <h2>Dracula</h2>

            <div>

                <p>"Look here, sir," I said, "does what you have to do concern the Count?"</p>

                <p>"It does," he said solemnly.</p>

                <p>"Then I am with you heart and soul. As you go by the 10:30 train, you will not have time to read
                    them; but I shall get the bundle of papers. You can take them with you and read them in the train."
                </p>

                <p>After breakfast I saw him to the station. When we were parting he said:--</p>

                <p>"Perhaps you will come to town if I send to you, and take Madam Mina too."</p>

                <p>"We shall both come when you will," I said.</p>

                <p>I had got him the morning papers and the London papers of the previous night, and while we were
                    talking at the carriage window, waiting for the train to start, he was turning them over. His eyes
                    suddenly seemed to catch something in one of them, "The Westminster Gazette"--I knew it by the
                    colour--and he grew quite white. He read something intently, groaning to himself: "Mein Gott! Mein
                    Gott! So soon! so soon!" I do not think he remembered me at the moment. Just then the whistle blew,
                    and the train moved off. This recalled him to himself, and he leaned out of the window and waved his
                    hand, calling out: "Love to Madam Mina; I shall write so soon as ever I can." 26 September.--Truly
                    there is no such thing as finality. Not a week since I said "Finis," and yet here I am starting
                    fresh again, or rather going on with the same record. Until this afternoon I had no cause to think
                    of what is done. Renfield had become, to all intents, as sane as he ever was. He was already well
                    ahead with his fly business; and he had just started in the spider line also; so he had not been of
                    any trouble to me. I had a letter from Arthur, written on Sunday, and from it I gather that he is
                    bearing up wonderfully well. Quincey Morris is with him, and that is much of a help, for he himself
                    is a bubbling well of good spirits. Quincey wrote me a line too, and from him I hear that Arthur is
                    beginning to recover something of his old buoyancy; so as to them all my mind is at rest. As for
                    myself, I was settling down to my work with the enthusiasm which I used to have for it, so that I
                    might fairly have said that the wound which poor Lucy left on me was becoming cicatrised. Everything
                    is, however, now reopened; and what is to be the end God only knows. I have an idea that Van Helsing
                    thinks he knows, too, but he will only let out enough at a time to whet curiosity. He went to Exeter
                    yesterday, and stayed there all night. To-day he came back, and almost bounded into the room at
                    about half-past five o'clock, and thrust last night's "Westminster Gazette" into my hand.</p>

                <p>"What do you think of that?" he asked as he stood back and folded his arms.</p>

                <p>I looked over the paper, for I really did not know what he meant; but he took it from me and pointed
                    out a paragraph about children being decoyed away at Hampstead. It did not convey much to me, until
                    I reached a passage where it described small punctured wounds on their throats. An idea struck me,
                    and I looked up. "Well?" he said.</p>

                <p>"It is like poor Lucy's."</p>
