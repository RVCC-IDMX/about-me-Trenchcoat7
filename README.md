My name is Katie Strong!

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/5a86f0a3-39e5-4f58-a941-4e8b6f4d6544/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/about-me-trenchcoat7/deploys)

This project's purpose is to introduce myself. I am a musician, a gamer, an artist and a programmed- kind of a "jack of all trades but master of none" type of deal. This site is to post about stuff that I'm passionate about.
In this Web Development Course, I learned a lot about coding for html and css, and how to style a website especially. I learned useful skills such as flexbox, boxes, syntax for coding css/html, and a lot, lot more. I used css to make my site look presentable, such as using nicer fonts than the default, using color palettes (mine is strawberry themed!!) and using grids and boxes to line up items the way I want to. I also learned about copyright and how it works.
If I were to add onto this project, I would ass samples of music that I like/am composing at the moment. I could also make a small diary about my life, and let people see into my thoughts.

My site is free for anyone to use as long as they credit my work.
